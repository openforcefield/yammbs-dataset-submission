This submission is slightly different from future submissions because of the
changes suggested in
[#7](https://github.com/openforcefield/yammbs-dataset-submission/pull/7).
Namely, the dataset name and `chunksize` are now passed via the command line
rather than being part of a config file (`industry.yaml` in this case). For that
reason, a copy of the version of `download_and_filter_dataset.py` (previously
called `new_dataset.py`) is also included here.
