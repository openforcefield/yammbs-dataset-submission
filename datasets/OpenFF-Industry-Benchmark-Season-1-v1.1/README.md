This submission is slightly different from future submissions because of the
changes suggested in #7. Namely, the dataset name and `chunksize` are now passed
via the command line rather than being part of a config file (`industry.yaml` in
this case). For that reason, a copy of the version of
`download_and_filter_dataset.py` (previously called `new_dataset.py`) is also
included here.
